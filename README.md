Pass/Fail Classification Streamlit Deployment
This repository contains a simple machine learning project that uses logistic regression for pass/fail classification based on study hours and playing hours. The trained model is saved as model.pkl, and the project is deployed using Streamlit.

Project Structure
model.pkl: The trained logistic regression model saved as a pickle file.
app.py: The Streamlit web application script for deployment.
requirements.txt: List of dependencies required to run the project.
Prerequisites
Before running the Streamlit app, ensure you have the required dependencies installed. You can install them using the following command:


pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Clone the repository to your local machine:


git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pass-fail-classification-streamlit.git
Navigate to the project directory:



cd pass-fail-classification-streamlit
Run the Streamlit app:



streamlit run app.py
Open your browser and go to http://localhost:8501 to access the deployed Streamlit app.

Streamlit App Overview
The Streamlit app consists of a simple user interface with input fields for study hours and playing hours. Once the user inputs the study and playing hours, the app uses the trained logistic regression model (model.pkl) to predict whether the student will pass or fail. The result is displayed on the web interface.

Deployment Notes
The trained logistic regression model (model.pkl) is used for predictions within the Streamlit app.
Ensure that Streamlit is installed (pip install streamlit) before running the app.
Adjustments to the model or app logic can be made in the app.py script as needed.
